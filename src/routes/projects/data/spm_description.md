**Opportunity:** Precisely manage hundreds of Spotify playlists built up over time in a shared account.

**Solution:** A full-stack web application with a connection Spotify’s API.

**Tech Highlight:** [React](https://react.dev) & [BaseWeb](https://baseweb.design) backed by [Fastify](https://fastify.dev) on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), all written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and managed with [Nx](https://nx.dev)

**Takeaways:** I could have used any of the existing [playlist management tools](https://www.reddit.com/r/spotify/comments/deezyp/migrating_liked_songs_to_another_accountnew/) out there, but then I wouldn’t have learned about OAuth2.
