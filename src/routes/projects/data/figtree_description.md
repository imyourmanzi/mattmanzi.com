**Opportunity:** Try my hand at building a “dotfiles” repository.

**Solution:** While most people (for good reason) just keep a set of static files, I built an automated bootstrapping system.

**Tech Highlight:** Written entirely in bash shell scripts for strong portability, templated for maximum flexibility.

**Takeaways:** This project keeps me sharp with shell scripting techniques and tools. It's also my [automation trade-off](https://xkcd.com/1205/) project.
