**Opportunity:** Demonstrate my ability to both reverse engineer and write a functioning program in assembly.

**Solution:** A special game of Tic Tac Toe where mines can be placed on the board to foil your opponent’s plan.

**Tech Highlight:** Pure x86 assembly

**Takeaway:** I learned why mid- and high-level programming languages, and their compilers, are so valuable—thank you [Grace Hopper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper)—and also to appreciate the power and simplicity of writing code so close to the hardware.
